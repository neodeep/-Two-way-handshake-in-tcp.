In this project, using, two way handshake, reliability is tested on TCP
protocol. Therefore, client party and server party are connected if and only if they
are verified by two way handshake. If one party does not have this protocol, other
party refuse the connection because of no validation. Also, reliability of the protocol
has been tested by one application which is named “Wireshark”. Moreover, normal
TCP data transfer uses to compare with this project. Addition to this, screen shots are
provided according to the result has been captured along the project. In the
conclusion of project, according to the experiment results, some useful assumptions
will be given.
